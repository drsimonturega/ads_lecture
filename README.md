## Introduction

This is the file repository for a lecture in our "applications of data science" module. There will be a lecture portion of this session along with a Google copilots session where we will clone this repository,  clone my data science analysis library and have a quick look at some of the tasks we run in python on a model data set. Will use libraries including Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, seaborn and sklearn, plus my own data science library.

## Code development



Currently we run our analysis in the notebook [vs_supra_rep_002.ipynb](https://github.com/drsimonturega/vs_supra_rep/blob/main/vs_supra_rep_002.ipynb)

## File structure of the project
There are **.csv* files copied from the suplimentory information in the manscript. There are also two **.ipynb* one of which we will run in google colab in our session.
