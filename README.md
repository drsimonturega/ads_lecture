## Introduction

This is the file repository for a lecture in our "applications of data science" module. There will be a lecture portion of this session along with a Google copilots session where we will clone this repository,  clone my data science analysis library and have a quick look at some of the tasks we run in python on a model data set. Will use libraries including Pandas, Matplotlib and sklearn, plus my own data science library.

## Code development
This repoduces the analysis in the manuscript and then reanalysis the data using a current data science approach. The code is writen in python and run in a google colab notebook. It uses my data science library [simons_data_science_library](https://github.com/drsimonturega/simons_data_science_library) to facilitate the complettion of the task in a one hour session.

## Usage instructions
Currently we run our analysis in the notebook [vs_supra_rep_002.ipynb](https://github.com/drsimonturega/vs_supra_rep/blob/main/vs_supra_rep_002.ipynb)

## File structure of the project
There are **.txt* files copied from the suplimentory information in the manscript. There are also two **.ipynb* one of which we will run in google colab in our session.
